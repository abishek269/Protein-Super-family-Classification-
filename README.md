# Protein-Super-family-Classification

Proteins are large, complex biomolecules that play an essential role in the body. Proteins are made 
up of thousands of tiny units connected in a long chain called amino acids. Amino acids are simply 
represented by alphabets. There are 20 different most common and five uncommon types of amino 
acids that can be combined to form a protein. They are arranged randomly in sequences that build 
millions of unique proteins.


This project explores many machine learning and deep learning methods that can be used to classify protein families. 

The first part of the project uses physical and chemical properties of Protein to predict protein families using 3 different Machine Learning Modele (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest). 

The Second part of the project utilizes amino acid sequences to classify protein families using two Deep Learning Sequential models (LSTM and BiLSTM). 


The files should run in the following sequence:

(1) data_wrangling-EDA_final.ipynb

(2) model_ML_DL_final.ipynb

Further, the 'Capstone 3 Report.pdf' provides a non-technical summary of this project.
