Proteins are large, complex biomolecules that play an essential role in the body. Proteins are made 
up of thousands of tiny units connected in a long chain called amino acids. Amino acids are simply 
represented by alphabets. There are 20 different most common and five uncommon types of amino 
acids that can be combined to form a protein. They are arranged randomly in sequences that build 
millions of unique proteins.


This project aims to explore many machine learning and deep learning methods that can be used to classify 
protein families.
